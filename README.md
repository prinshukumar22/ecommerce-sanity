# This project was created using the following technologies:

    Sanity.io: A headless CMS that allows you to create and manage content in a structured way.
    Next.js: A React framework that makes it easy to build server-rendered and static websites.
    React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    Stripe: A payment processing platform that allows you to accept payments online.

The project uses Stripe to process payments for products that are purchased in the e-commerce store. When a user adds a product to their cart and clicks the "Checkout" button, they are taken to a Stripe checkout page where they can enter their payment information. Once the payment is processed, the product is added to the user's order history.

The project is also responsive and can be viewed on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. This is achieved by using the Next.js framework, which automatically generates static pages for each device.
